# NHS App: Design styles, components and patterns

A prototype to test new design styles, components and patterns for the NHS App.

Built using the [NHS prototype kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs) with added code from the [NHS App frontend](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsapp-frontend) so we can test [NHS App components](https://design-system.nhsapp.service.nhs.uk/components/).
