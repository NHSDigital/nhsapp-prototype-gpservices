# NHS App: Design system work

## About this repo

This is a place to test and document design styles, components and patterns being used on the NHS App.

## Background

The NHS App uses the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system), however it also uses many undocumented components and patterns. The NHS design system was originally made for use on websites and is not tailored to the needs and expectations of a mobile app. 

## NHS App styles, components and patterns

We use a GitHub project board to identify design styles. components and patterns being used on the NHS app, along with any work being done, including visual design changes, hypotheses, user insights etc. This then links back to the [NHS digital service manual community backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1).
